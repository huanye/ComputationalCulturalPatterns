The sign "佛系青年" is a Chinese word imported from Japan but has appeared frequently in Chinese online social networks. Its literal translation in English is "Buddha-like youngsters" who have "seen through the vanity of life" and held an attitude of being fine with anything and not taking anyone or anything too seriously. 

1. I chose this sign because the word represents a general view on how to lead a life for a group of Chinese youngsters nowadays, and this view now strongly influences those teenagers raised up in affluent families in particular. The phenomenon may be related to one traditional culture in ancient China: Taosim, with its core belief in inaction. In constrast with Confucianism's being attached to the secular world, Taosim advocates being detached to it.

2. The sign's object is the person who leads this particular lifestyle; the sign-vehicle is the Chinese word "佛系青年" itself, and the interpretant is that the Chinese word can be used to refer to those people holding this particular view of life.

3. The object relates to the sign-vehicle symbolically because the sign-vehicle, the word, represents the object through symbolic meaning, the group of youngsters with the particular lifestyle.

4. The sign-vehicle relates to interpretant rhematically because the word is representative and conveys the property of the object it refers to, and also it describes the qualitative possibility for the interpretant.

5. Yes the sign is a replica of a legisign, and the legisign is a cultural convention for a group of Chinese youngsters who hold an attitude of being fine with anything and not taking anyone or anything too seriously. The convention has its root in one ancient Chinese philosophy Taoism and was held and believed by generations of demoted offcials and average people in ancient China. Now the word has appeared in all kinds of online social networks and become one of the buzzwords for Chinese netizens to describe Chinese youngsters with no desires, no needs and no expectations. The word "佛系青年" was also one of the top ten popular words in 2008 according to the Baidu Index, the counterpart of Google Trend in China. So I think the word "佛系青年" is a replica of the legisign and Chinese netizens are now using it widely and frequently.
